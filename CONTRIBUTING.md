Thanks very much for considering contributing to `prisonbrief`!

Following these guidelines helps to communicate that you respect the time of the developers managing and developing
this open source project. In return, they should reciprocate that respect in addressing your issue, assessing changes,
and helping you finalize your pull requests.

There are many ways in which you can contribute. The first one is by pointing out errors that we may have made.
You can report a bug by [opening an issue on GitHub](https://github.com/danilofreire/prisonbrief/issues). 
The developers will address the issues as soon as possible. 

You can also request a new feature or suggest enhancements to current functions of the package. Please also open 
an issue to do so.

In terms of coding style, we have adopted a very relaxed approach. Commits can have emoticons or short sentences, with
or without a longer description. R code should preferably follow the style we have been using: 
please use underscores for variables and functions, indent your code and add spacing to it.

If you submit a pull request, please make sure the code compiles without errors. If possible, use an
external service such as Travis-CI or similar to test your code.

Thanks for reading all that! Feel free to send us a message if you any questions!

# Summary

`prisonbrief` is an R package that downloads, cleans and returns tidy data [@wickham2014tidy] from the [World Prison Brief website](http://www.prisonstudies.org/). The World Prison Brief [-@icpr2017prison] is an online database compiled by the [Institute for Criminal Policy Research](http://www.icpr.org.uk/) with information on prison systems around the world. Data currently cover 223 jurisdictions and have been collected from public sources. The `prisonbrief` package provides three easy-to-use functions that convert WPB data into a format convenient for statistical analysis. Researchers interested in comparative prison systems -- such as criminologists, sociologists and economists -- can use the output from functions in the package to create maps, plot time series graphs and calculate descriptive statistics with only a few lines of code.
